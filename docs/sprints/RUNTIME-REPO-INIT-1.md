# RUNTIME-REPO-INIT-1: Librarian Runtime Node Repository Initialization

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Local path:** `G:\openwork\librarian-runtime-node\`
**Remote:** `https://github.com/andrewdhannah/librarian-runtime-node.git`

---

## Purpose

Initialize `librarian-runtime-node` as its own GitHub-backed repository with
a proper project identity, README, custody structure, and first baseline import.

This establishes an independent Git home for the Windows runtime node, separate
from the canonical Librarian repo at `G:\openwork\thelibrarian\`.

---

## Starting State

- **Git:** Not initialized (no `.git` directory)
- **Working tree:** 7 directories, 1 existing README (minimal/operational), router code, config, scripts
- **Large files:** `runtime\llama.cpp\llama-server.exe` (65.8 MB) — excluded from git
- **Model files:** None present (`models/` contains only `.keep`)
- **Secrets:** None present (`config/runtime-node.local.json` has machine-local paths, gitignored)
- **Process state:** 1 orphan `llama-server.exe` (PID 948) from prior restart testing

## Closeout

```
Sprint:               RUNTIME-REPO-INIT-1
Status:               COMPLETE
Final HEAD:           (first commit)
Working tree:         (after commit)
Harness result:       N/A (repo init — no runtime verification)
Stash state:          N/A
Next sprint:          WIN-SERVICE-LIFECYCLE-1 (startup only)
```

## Notes

- SSH key not configured on this machine; remote uses HTTPS.
- Push requires authentication (see commit step for result).
- The orphan `llama-server.exe` (PID 948) remains as a known lifecycle gap.
- Evidence files from WIN-ROUTER-IMPL-1 remain at `G:\openwork\thelibrarian\fixtures\windows-runtime-node\router-impl\` and were imported here as reference copies.
