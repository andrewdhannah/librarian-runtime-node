## Proof Chain Complete

The three-link runtime proof chain is sealed:

| Link | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| 1. Source HEAD proof | `e7cfe33` (runtime-node), `1e32002` (main) |
| 2. Artifact hash proof | SHA-256 `84EB797A715FDC4CDB634A85FDFEC5C81CB90F37FB700F6EA6C97576B9569DC9` |
| 3. Governed rebuild proof | Rebuild hash matches receipt; 38/38 qualification gate passed |

**Key infrastructure:**
- v2 receipt schema at `receipts/runtime-integration/schema-v2.json`
- 48-check receipt verifier at `scripts/verify-receipt.ps1`
- Integration proof v2 script at `scripts/run-integration-proof-v2.ps1`
- Qualification scripts at `scripts/run-runtime-qualification.ps1` and `scripts/verify-runtime-qualification.ps1`
- Full environment baseline at `docs/planning/WIN-AGENT-HARNESS-ENV-BASELINE-1-BASELINE.md`
- 8 findings recorded for follow-up sprints (see baseline report)

## Pre-Work Checklist (next session must run)

1. Verify both repos' current HEAD — do not assume prior values
2. Verify working tree is clean on both repos
3. Verify `LibrarianRunTimeNode` service is Stopped / Manual before testing
4. Verify port 9130 is free before testing
5. Verify no orphan `llama-server`, `rust-router`, or Python router processes
6. Do not weaken the network boundary
7. If auth/token setup blocks proof, generate a temporary local token (do not ask Owner to paste secrets)
8. Refer to `docs/roadmap/WINDOWS-PC-SPRINT-ROADMAP.md` for current sprint priority
9. Consult `docs/planning/WIN-AGENT-HARNESS-ENV-BASELINE-1-BASELINE.md` for full machine environment reference
10. Address or defer findings from baseline report (see Findings Register §24) before starting service-level work
11. Optionally run `.\scripts\harness\run-contract-checks.ps1 -AllSafe` before starting new work to validate existing contract tests

## Next Sprint Specification

**WIN-HARNESS-CUSTODY-LEDGER-1** — Implement a custody ledger that records
every discrete action performed by the harness across sprints.

### Why this comes next
The nine-tool harness core is now complete:

- Pre-flight: `scripts/harness/pre-mutation-check.ps1`
- Post-flight: `scripts/harness/postflight-check.ps1`
- Receipt generation (sprint): `scripts/harness/new-sprint-receipt.ps1`
- Contract runner: `scripts/harness/run-contract-checks.ps1`
- Baseline drift detection: `scripts/harness/baseline-diff.ps1`
- Sprint ledger: `project-state/sprint-ledger.json`
- Sprint ledger validator: `scripts/harness/validate-sprint-ledger.ps1`
- Drift triage: `WIN-RUST-TOOLCHAIN-DRIFT-TRIAGE-1` (investigated rustc NOT_FOUND)
- Path restore: `WIN-RUST-PATH-RESTORE-1` (recreated `.cargo\bin\` proxy shims, drift cleared)
- **Action receipts**: `scripts/harness/new-action-receipt.ps1` (granular action-level receipts)

The rustup proxy shim directory has been recreated with wrapper `.cmd` scripts in
`%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin\`. `rustc 1.96.0` and `cargo 1.96.0` are accessible from PATH.
Run `baseline-diff -Section rust_version` to verify.

The next sprint extends the action receipt infrastructure with a custody ledger.
Note: WIN-HARNESS-CLEANUP-1 (C: drive space reclamation) should be considered
only if a fresh baseline-diff or disk check confirms C: is critically low.

See `docs/planning/WIN-PC-REMAINING-SPRINTS-PLAN.md` for the full remaining sprint map.

### After WIN-HARNESS-ACTION-RECEIPTS-1
- **WIN-HARNESS-ACTION-RECEIPTS-1** ✅ Done: granular action receipts implemented
- **WIN-HARNESS-CUSTODY-LEDGER-1** (recommended): action custody ledger
- **WIN-HARNESS-CLEANUP-1**: C: drive space cleanup (only if baseline-diff confirms critical)

## Key Environment Facts (from Baseline)

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Host | DESKTOP-ISNJ51B — MSI MS-7751 |
| CPU | i5-3570K — 4 cores, 3.40 GHz |
| RAM | 24.3 GB |
| GPU | Radeon RX 570 4 GB (Vulkan) |
| C: free space | **10.2 GB (9.2%) — CRITICAL** |
| G: free space | 132.3 GB (28.5%) |
| Local IP | 192.168.0.158/24 (Wi-Fi) |
| PS version | 5.1 (no pwsh) |
| Python | 3.14.3 |
| Node | 24.14.0 |
| Rust | 1.96.0 |
| nssm | Not in PATH (available at `runtime/bin/nssm.exe`) |
| Elevation | Non-admin (service control requires elevation) |

## Network Boundary Policy (do not weaken)

- Default bind: `127.0.0.1`
- LAN bind requires explicit `ROUTER_HOST`
- Auth via `ROUTER_AUTH_TOKEN` / `ROUTER_REQUIRE_AUTH`
- No token leaks in logs
- Body size bounded by `ROUTER_MAX_BODY_BYTES` (Python router: 64KB)
- Receipts must not contain tokens, bearer strings, or authorization headers

## Known Issues

1. **SSH key not configured.** Remote uses HTTPS. Push requires authentication credentials.
2. **Swift test cannot run on Windows.** The Swift toolchain is unavailable. Any `TheLibrarian-main` integration work on Windows is manual audit / proof-script only.
3. **Ad-hoc `rust-router` orphan risk.** When running the router outside NSSM for a proof run, it must be killed after the proof. Always check after closing.
4. **model-profiles.json metadata gaps.** Missing fields: `verified_context`, `verified_ngl`, `stability`, `requires_reduced_offload`, `notes`. Scheduled for WIN-RUNTIME-PROFILES-CLEANUP-1.

## Anti-Loop Rules (see `docs/operations/WINDOWS-AGENT-STARTUP-SEQUENCE.md`)

- Stop after two failed attempts at the same command, test, or code path.
- Do not broaden sprint scope after a timeout.
- Do not rewrite working code to fix unrelated failures.
- Before retrying, record: command, failure, hypothesis, smallest next action.
- If service state becomes ambiguous, restore first: stop service/router/backend, free port 9130, confirm no llama-server orphans.
- Never mutate both repos unless the sprint explicitly requires it.
- Never commit generated cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`).
- Never sweep pre-existing dirty files into a sprint commit without explicit scope.
- If auth/token setup blocks proof, generate a temporary local token; do not ask the Owner to paste secrets.
- Receipts may report partial/fail; do not edit evidence to force pass.

## Process Corrections

### Recorded: WIN-HARNESS-BASELINE-DIFF-1 — Premature Push

**Incident:** Sprint `WIN-HARNESS-BASELINE-DIFF-1` was committed and pushed
(`a8fd165`) before explicit Owner `APPROVE_AND_SEAL` instruction. The agent
transitioned from "ready for review" to "pushed" without Owner authorization.

**Correction:** Owner reviewed and ratified the sprint after the fact (Option A).
Technical content accepted. Process rule tightened below.

**Rule:** Future sprints must NOT commit or push from "ready for review" state.
Commit and push requires explicit Owner `APPROVE_AND_SEAL` (or equivalent)
instruction. Present completed work for review; wait for approval before pushing.

### Recorded: rust_version NOT_FOUND in baseline diff

**Observation:** The frozen baseline recorded `rustc 1.96.0` at
`C:\Users\andre\.cargo\bin\rustc.exe`. Current baseline-diff queries show
`NOT_FOUND` — the binary is no longer present at that path (directory does not
exist). This is not an immediate blocker since no active Rust/service sprint
is in progress, but should be verified before the next Rust build/qualification.

---

## Boundaries

- No NSSM install or service mutation without elevation and owner approval.
- No model downloads.
- No GGUF/safetensors/LLM binary files committed.
- `LibrarianRunTimeNode` remains Manual startup unless explicitly changed.
- Do not kill unrelated processes.
- Always verify orphan processes before starting work.
- Network boundary must not be weakened.
- Anti-loop rules apply to all Windows/runtime sprints.
